/*
 * base.less
 * =========
 * Base stylesheet
 * ---------------
 *
 *
 * Feel free to load/unload components in this file
 *
 * Note that "pool" directory contains basic components
 * that are reusable from project to project. By default,
 * all components are loaded from pool, however, if you
 * require to modify/customize one of them, copy and paste
 * it into "app" directory and modify as required.
 *
 * When any pool component is updated, you can easily track
 * the difference between app/ and pool/ versions to decide
 * whether you want to replace one with another
 * Additionally, you can easily test updated component
 * by changing the 'path' in your staging stylesheet.
 *
 * If you can think of any component suitable for pool,
 * that is not there yet, feel free to pull request
 *
 * 
 * Do NOT load components from inside other components
 *	  ..by doing so you may lose control over them
 *
 * For non-responsive design this file should contain
 *	  everything you need in most cases
 *
 * For responsive design, it's recommended to load layout
 * 	  that is suited to small-screen devices in this stylesheet
 *	  and add 2 external stylesheets:
 *	  	1) Stylesheet that contains various layouts
 * 				   wrapped in media queries
 *		3) IE8 and below specific stylesheet that contains
 *				   one layout
 *	  for more details read this article:

	ADD MODULES & HELPERS

	with other components
\*-------------------------------------------------------------------*/
// Helpers - undependent small reusable CSS snippets consisting of pure CSS only
// These shouldn't be used by other .less files, only by classes in HTML markup
// Helper Example:     	.left { text-align: left; }
// Load Example: 		@import 'pool/helpers/helper_name/helper_name.less';

// Modules - undependent UI elements
// These shouldn't be used by other .less files, only by classes and IDs in HTML markup
// Module Example:		a "media object" with an image to the left and descriptive content to the right
// Load Example: 		@import 'pool/modules/module_name/module_name.less';
