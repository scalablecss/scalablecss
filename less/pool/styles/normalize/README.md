normalize.css
=============

Normalize.css is a customisable CSS file that makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards. We researched the differences between default browser styles in order to precisely target only the styles that need normalizing.  We currently support Mozilla Firefox 3+, Apple Safari 4+, Chrome 10+, Opera 10+, and Internet Explorer 6+.
